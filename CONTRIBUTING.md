# Contributing Guidelines

Hi there! Welcome to the k3d and Rancher Community!
We welcome everyone who likes to use and improve our software.

## Getting Started

Before starting to work with and on k3d, please read and understand our [**Code of Conduct**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Before opening an issue or a Pull-Request, please use GitHub's search function to check whether something similar is already in process and hook in there instead.

## Get Recognized

We want to foster a collaborative environment, where every contribution is welcomed and recognized.

If you want to show up in our Contributors section, please make use of the @all-contributors bot integrated with this repository.

Here's a full guide on using the bot: <https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage>.
The simplest way to use it is (in a comment on an issue or a pull-request): `@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>`, where `<contributions>` is a [list of contributions](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).
